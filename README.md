# Caesar Cipher 🔐
A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm.  
This project shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, allowing you to encode and decode secret messages.

I built this project as part of the **FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certification**.

## 📚 Features
- Encrypt messages using a shift value
- Decrypt messages back to their original form
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetical characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers)
- Handles positive and negative shift values

---

## 🧠 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher replaces each letter of your message with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Example with a shift of **+3**:
- A → D  
- B → E  
- H → K  
- "hello" → "khoor"
